# Election_Analysis

# Project Overview
A board of elections employee wanted to audit an election they had recently. We were asked to:
1. Calculate total votes.
2. Get a list of all candidates.
3. Calculate how many votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of vote share.
5. Determine the winner of the election. 

## Resources
- Election_results.csv
- Python 3.9.3, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Summary
- The total number of votes cast was: 369, 711
- The counties that voted and their respective vote share was: Jefferson 10.5% (38,855), Denver 82.8% (305,055), Arapahoe 6.7% (24,801).
The county with the largest vote share was Denver.
- The candidates running in this election were: Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, and Raymon Anthony Doane.
- Each candidates receieved 23.0% (85,213), 73.8% (272, 892), and 3.1% (11,606) of votes respectively.

The winner was: Diana DeGette who receieved 73.8% (272, 892) of votes.
## Challenge Overview
- The overview of the challenge was to use python to open and read a csv file, then use that file to analyze election results quickly and then write and save the results to a text file. 
## Challenge Summary
- This script allows for quick analyses and summary of key information regarding voter county, and each candidates share of votes. This script saves all key data onto a simple text file that can be copied and documented for future use. This scipt can use any excel file and therefore any election data. 
- Modifications would need to be made to the script surrounding the file path, as well as the format of the excel file being used.
